# Dev Security

How a "security" tab in the browsers developer tools might work.

Inspiration from Joel and Chris on the Google Chrome [security-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/security-dev/yifaG5bDr8Q/lHgsAGs-kEUJ) mailing list.

And there is an [interactive demo](https://craigfrancis.github.io/dev-security/).
